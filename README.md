A machine learning approach to predicting the types of tenants to fill vacancies in shopping centers. This repository contains a few main things: the data, the code for the machine learning model, the online Store Prospector system, and the code used in the analysis of the successfulness of the model (e.g code for charts). 

The paper explaining the research can be found at __________.

Overall, the method isn't ready to be used in the shopping center industry yet; but with better and more extensive data, the methods used in this research can easily be reused in creating the next version of a machine learning system that predicts what store types should fill vacancies.
